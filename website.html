                <img src="thumbnails/Ms swamy.jpeg"class="bio-image">
                <p>
                    Mankombu Sambasivan Swaminathan (7 August 1925 â€“ 28 September 2023) was an Indian agronomist, agricultural scientist, plant geneticist, administrator, and humanitarian. A global leader of the green revolution, he is widely known as the "Father of the Green Revolution in India" for his role in introducing and further developing high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice. Swaminathan's collaborative scientific efforts with Norman Borlaug, spearheading a mass movement with farmers and other scientists, saved India and Pakistan from certain famine-like conditions in the 1960s.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His leadership as the Director General of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and later the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) was instrumental in the development of sustainable and pro-poor agricultural policies. He was a passionate advocate for moving from a "green" to an "evergreen revolution" to ensure productivity in perpetuity without associated ecological harm.

                <h2>The Green Revolution</h2>
                <p>
                    The Green Revolution was a period when agricultural productivity in India increased significantly due to the adoption of new technologies. Dr. Swaminathan was the main architect of this revolution. He worked on adapting and introducing high-yielding dwarf wheat varieties from Mexico to Indian fields. This, combined with the use of fertilizers and modern irrigation techniques, led to a massive increase in food grain production, making India self-sufficient in food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His work involved not just scientific innovation but also a deep understanding of the socio-economic conditions of Indian farmers. He championed the cause of small and marginal farmers, ensuring that the benefits of new technologies reached them.
